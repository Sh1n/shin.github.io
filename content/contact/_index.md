I am a Lead Data Engineer and Digital Product Developer with a comprehensive approach to software development. My focus extends beyond code creation, encompassing the entire production journey and the end-user value. The same principle applies to data solutions.

My enthusiasm drives me to embrace new and open-source technologies whenever possible, thereby expanding my skill set. Yet, my unwavering commitment remains centered on understanding user needs and meeting stakeholder expectations.

In my role as Lead Data Engineer, I have overseen the construction of a sophisticated data platform, catering to both B2B and B2C product suites across diverse sectors. Additionally, I have taken the lead in developing digital products for prominent players in various markets such as edutech, fintech, martech, gdo, telco, and travel industry.
