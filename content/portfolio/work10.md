## **Project Commencement and Evolution**

I embarked on this project as a part of my thesis, laying the foundation for what would evolve into a comprehensive web application with far-reaching capabilities. The project initially centered around the design and development of an interface for reading and managing a Knowledge Organization System (referred to as KOS). Over time, this endeavor expanded to become an extensible web application, instrumental in deploying data-driven interfaces.

## **Design Phase**

The journey commenced with a meticulous design phase, marked by the following key activities:

- **User Experience Studies**: At the project's inception, I conducted in-depth User Experience studies by engaging with various members of the research group. These studies offered valuable insights into their daily usage of the existing KOS interface and related tools.
- **Component Design**: I meticulously designed components, each intended for use in various sections of the new interface. These designs were rooted in the data models that formed the foundation of the KOS.
- **Modular Web Interface**: The heart of the design lay in the creation of a modular and extensible web interface, characterized by the concept of internal applications. Each of these applications was tailor-made to cater to different business processes, meticulously aligned with the specific requirements of our customers.
- **RESTful API**: A key aspect of the design included the creation of a RESTful API. This API played a pivotal role in interconnecting our system, the main product of the research group, with third-party services, thereby enhancing the overall functionality of the system.

## **Implementation Phase**

The project transitioned seamlessly from design to implementation, and I took on the responsibility of developing both the backend and frontend of the application. Notably, the entire implementation was executed using JavaScript, leveraging the power of Angular and Node.js.

## **Expanded Responsibilities**

As the project gained momentum and the group recognized its potential as a cornerstone for their business proposals, I assumed additional responsibilities. These included:

- **Project Management**: Managing various research projects within the group, ensuring seamless integration and collaboration among team members.
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Eliciting the requirements of stakeholders and meticulously designing solutions that hinged on our technology, ensuring that they aligned with our overarching project goals.

This project reflects my journey as a Full Stack Developer, encompassing design, development, and a significant expansion of responsibilities. It underscores my ability to engineer solutions that are not only technically robust but also aligned with the diverse needs of stakeholders and end-users.
