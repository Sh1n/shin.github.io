I am a Fractional CTO, Data/SW/AI Engineer, and Founder with extensive experience building innovative platforms for startups, scale-ups, and corporates. Currently serving as Head of Data at Tebi, an Amsterdam-based fintech startup that recently secured â‚¬30M in Series B funding from Alphabet's CapitalG.

My approach extends beyond code creation, encompassing the entire production journey from architecture to deployment, with a strong focus on delivering end-user value and business impact. With a background that includes Meta, BUX, Oney, and Nokia, I bring a proven track record of scaling data platforms and leading technical teams at a global level.

I specialize in software/cloud/data/ML engineering and have successfully built sophisticated data platforms catering to both B2B and B2C product suites across diverse sectors including fintech, edutech, martech, retail, hospitality, telco, and travel industries. My passion for open-source technologies and cutting-edge solutions is matched by my commitment to understanding user needs and exceeding stakeholder expectations.
