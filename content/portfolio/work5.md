In my multifaceted role as a solution architect, team lead and manager, I orchestrated a range of operational and managerial activities that were pivotal to the digital transformation of our retail industry-focused business. This transformation began with a comprehensive overhaul of our software infrastructure and key operational procedures, ultimately culminating in the design, development, and deployment of a robust big-data architecture. This architecture was engineered to seamlessly handle data ingestion, integration, analysis, and delivery of valuable insights to our end users.

- **Backend Development**: I crafted efficient Laravel (PHP) backends for user-facing applications, ensuring rapid development of CRUD frontends. In addition, I employed Flask (Python) for KPIs Rest-API and for managing long-lasting jobs triggered by HTTP calls.
- **ETL Development**: I constructed ETL (Python) code to facilitate the ingestion and staging of source datasets, a pivotal step in our data journey.
- **Data Warehousing**: I managed the Snowflake (SQL) virtual data warehouse, responsible for delivering actionable insights and stored procedures essential for transforming, integrating, and refining ingested data.
- **Workflow Automation**: I implemented Airflow for the automation of critical processes and integration pipelines.
- **BI Tool Integration**: I seamlessly integrated various Business Intelligence (BI) tools, such as G Data Studio, Tableau, and Power BI, into our product suite to enhance our analytics capabilities.
- **Infrastructure Management**: I maintained Infrastructure-as-a-Code (Terraform) to provision our comprehensive solution on cloud platforms, including Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud.
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: I oversaw the maintenance of Helm charts to facilitate the deployment of our solutions on Kubernetes.

## Tech Lead Responsibilities

As the Tech Lead, I took on a broader leadership role with the following responsibilities:

- **Strategic Planning**: I devised and oversaw the development of IT solutions, aligning our technological direction with our broader business strategy.
- **Budgeting**: I proposed budgets for the maintenance and development of IT solutions, ensuring optimal resource allocation.
- **Vendor Management**: I managed relationships with contractors and suppliers when outsourcing development projects, maintaining quality standards.
- **Team Leadership**: I orchestrated development efforts with our diverse team members, fostering an Agile work environment for efficient product development.
- **Team Growth**: I prioritized the growth of our IT team members, setting annual objectives and measurable KPIs to enhance their competencies and experience.

My multifaceted role encompassed a spectrum of responsibilities that blended hands-on development with strategic leadership, ensuring the seamless integration of technology with our business objectives. This portfolio showcases my commitment to driving innovation and excellence in our digital journey.
