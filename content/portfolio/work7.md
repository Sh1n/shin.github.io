During my tenure as a Data Engineer at Meta, I played a pivotal role in a transformative project of global significance. My mandate was to establish a robust data foundation that underpinned data-informed decision-making processes. I actively bridged the gap between Data Infrastructure and Data Science domains, ensuring the seamless integration of both to drive impactful results.

## **Key Responsibilities**

My responsibilities in this ambitious endeavor included:

- **Project Management**: I assumed the role of managing and effectively communicating the scope of an extensive data-backed project with far-reaching implications.
- **Data Truth-Set Identification**: I spearheaded the identification and acquisition of truth-sets data, making them readily available to decision-makers, thus providing a solid basis for informed choices.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Leveraging the power of machine learning, I orchestrated the integration and deployment of cutting-edge models. These models were instrumental in extracting valuable knowledge and insights that propelled the project forward.
- **Dashboard Development**: I took charge of designing and implementing data visualization dashboards. These dashboards served as powerful tools for metric visualization and trend analysis, facilitating a clear understanding of project dynamics and outcomes.

My role in this global-scale project exemplifies my ability to drive transformation through data engineering and contribute to data-informed decision-making processes.
